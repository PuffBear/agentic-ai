# ✅ Communication Tab Fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

The Communication tab was blank because the code was in the wrong place. I've fixed it!

**Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ Tab7 code was inside `get_churn_risk()` function
2. ✅ Import was in the wrong location  
3. ✅ Moved to proper place in `main()` function
