**To-Do:**

For this assignment, you will use agentic AI frameworks to build predictive models for any one of the above-mentioned datasets.

***Task 1: Your agentic AI framework should be addressing as many of the features as suggested in the following article.***

To refer to how agentic AI is changing the data analytics scenario – please refer to the following link.

***Task 2: Implement measures from the following article to evaluate the correctness of your agentic framework.***

While building frameworks with agentic AI seems to need little coding ability, ensuring that they are correct is a different matter together. The following article provides in-depth discussion on how agentic systems can be evaluated.

***Task 3: Analysis and Presentation of Results and Findings***  

Along with the design of the final system, you will also present your experience, understanding and findings about how agentic systems are built, evaluated and used. You will also talk about the challenges faced.

Note: Outside of the above-mentioned specifications, you are completely free to experiment.

Note: Please use free models only.

**This will be due at the end of the semester during the reading week. No extensions will be given for this.**
